          <div>
            <p>In&nbsp;many cases, the most advantageous solution involves flexible payment schemes with seller participation. We&nbsp;professionally structure deferred payments and &rsquo;Earn-Out&rsquo; agreements (payment of&nbsp;the remainder upon achieving key performance indicators). This reduces your initial financial risk and ensures that the financial interests of&nbsp;both the seller and the buyer remain aligned during the transition period.</p>
